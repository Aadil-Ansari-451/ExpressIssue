INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING YOUR MATRIX IMAGE:

1. Save your Matrix image as "matrix_bg.png"
2. Place it in this folder (static/)
3. The image should be high resolution (recommended: 1920x1080 or larger)
4. The application will automatically use it as the background

The buttons are positioned to align with the hands in your Matrix image:
- Left hand area: 25% from left edge (Charge button)
- Right hand area: 25% from right edge (Credit button)

If you need to adjust the button positions, edit the CSS in templates/index.html:
- .left-hand-area { left: 25%; }
- .right-hand-area { right: 25%; }
